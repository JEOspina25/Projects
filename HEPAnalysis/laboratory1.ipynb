    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Z boson is an elementary particle that mediates the weak interaction. It is a neutral particle with a mass of 91.1876 GeV/c^2. It is a very short-lived particle with a lifetime of 2.6Ã—10^-25 s. The Z boson decays into a pair of fermions, and the branching ratio for each fermion is determined by the weak mixing angle. The Z boson can decay into a pair of neutrinos, but it is difficult to detect neutrinos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will focus on the decay of Z boson into a pair of charged leptons. The branching ratio for the decay of Z boson into a pair of charged leptons is 3.3658%. In this laboratory, we will search for Z boson by looking for a pair of charged leptons that have the same flavor and opposite charge. We will use simulated data with MadGraph and analyze it with python.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Import data from root file\n",
    "* Plot histograms like TBrowser shows\n",
    "* aply cuts to the data \n",
    "* Find Z boson mass peak\n",
    "* Fit the peak with a Gaussian function or something else\n",
    "* Report the mass of Z boson with its uncertainty\n",
    "* Compare the result with the known value of Z boson mass (91.1876 GeV/c^2)\n",
