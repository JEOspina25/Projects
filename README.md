# Projects
In this space, you will be able to see some of the projects I have worked on. These projects cover a wide range of topics, but they all revolve around physics and computation.

Particle in a Magnetic Field: I investigate the trajectory of a charged particle as it travels through a uniform magnetic field. Both the code and a detailed physical description are provided.
